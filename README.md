## PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Excellent work here on the documentation - your Purpose, Audience, Goal, Persona and Use Case are all clearly defined and well done. You may optionally want to add additional details to your plan if it would help you identify specific ways to set yourself apart as a developer. For example - if you wanted to work for corporate, educational or government institutions versus a smaller advertising firm or development shop. Or maybe non-profits are what you are interested in. Just something to think about - what you have here is an overall sufficient direction for a good start. Your HTML is excellent - nice job.

The major issue you have is the directory structure needs to be reorganized. See the instructions in Edits &amp; Suggestions below.

As of now, I can't pass this Milestone until the directory structure is fixed. Make the corrections listed below by the due date and this Milestone will pass at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
Your directory structure needs to be corrected. Take another look at the [Milestone 1 Documentation](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-one/).
  1. Rename the directory on the server to "personal-web-page". Your PhpStorm deployment settings **will** need to be updated after this step. SSH in, and `cd` into your `public_html` directory. Then rename your project directory using the following command: `mv 'documentation' 'personal-web-page'`
  2. In PhpStorm, create a new directory named `public_html`. Move the `/images` directory inside there.
  3. Inside `public_html`, create a new directory named `documentation`. Move your `milestone-1.php` file inside there.
